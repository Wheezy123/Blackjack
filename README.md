Blackjack
=========

Blackjack game, written in procedural Ruby, playable via CLI

This is a very basic blackjack game playable in the command line interface. If you
don't have Ruby installed, then you should install it!
If you don't want to, you can go to http://www.repl.it and choose Ruby, and you can
copy/pase the code to run through their editor.
Note that this is a very rough first version, and will be updated in the future
